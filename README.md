## Project Overview

Dana is a data journalist writing a story about her hometown, McMinnville, Oregon and UFO sightings.  The town has an annual UFO enthusiast event celebrating the first sighting there in 1950 and all sightings since.  Dana would like to make a web page that allows users to search even more UFO sighting data.

Using Javascript, HTML and CSS, I've created a webpage that allows several different search parameters through a dataset.
